# Code Walkthrough

Welcome to the detailed code walkthrough for the **Tank Game** project! This guide will help you understand each line of the code, breaking down its functionality in a way that's beginner-friendly. Let's dive in!

## Class Definition

```vb
Public Class Form1
```
- **Public Class Form1**: This defines a new class named `Form1`, which represents the main window of our application. In Visual Basic, a class is a blueprint for creating objects, and here it will handle the game logic and user interface.

## Member Variables

```vb
Private DeltaTime As New DeltaTimeStructure(Now, Now, TimeSpan.Zero)
```
- **Private DeltaTime**: This variable holds an instance of `DeltaTimeStructure`, which is used to track the time elapsed between frames. It initializes with the current time (`Now`) and a zero time span.

```vb
Private OffScreen As New BufferManager(Me, BackColor)
```
- **Private OffScreen**: This creates a new `BufferManager` object, responsible for handling off-screen rendering to reduce flickering during drawing operations. It uses the form's background color.

```vb
Private Player As AudioPlayer
```
- **Private Player**: This declares a variable for managing audio playback in the game.

```vb
Private Turret As Turret
```
- **Private Turret**: This variable will hold an instance of the `Turret` class, which manages the tank's turret.

```vb
Private Projectiles As New ProjectileManager(Brushes.Red, New Drawing.Size(10, 10), 200, 100, 9)
```
- **Private Projectiles**: This initializes a `ProjectileManager` that handles the game's projectiles. It sets the projectile color to red, size to 10x10 pixels, and other parameters for behavior.

```vb
Private Controllers As XboxControllers
```
- **Private Controllers**: This variable will manage input from Xbox controllers.

```vb
Private ClientCenter As Point = New Point(ClientSize.Width / 2, ClientSize.Height / 2)
```
- **Private ClientCenter**: This calculates the center point of the client area (the drawable area) of the form, which is used for positioning objects.

```vb
Private Body As New Body(Brushes.Gray, New PointF(500, 500), 128, 64, 0, 0, 150, 30)
```
- **Private Body**: This creates an instance of the `Body` class, representing the tank's body. It sets its color to gray, position to (500, 500), and several other parameters defining its dimensions and physics properties.

```vb
Dim Arrow As New ArrowVector(New Pen(Color.Black, 10), New PointF(640, 360), 0, 60, 70, 10, 15, 0, Body.MaxVelocity, 30)
```
- **Dim Arrow**: This defines an `ArrowVector` that visually represents the direction and velocity of the tank. It initializes with a black pen, starting point, and various parameters for its behavior.

```vb
Private RelativeTurretAngle As Single
```
- **Private RelativeTurretAngle**: This variable will store the angle difference between the turret and the body of the tank.

### Input Tracking Variables

```vb
Private ADown As Boolean
Private DDown As Boolean
Private WDown As Boolean
Private SDown As Boolean
Private EDown As Boolean
Private F1Down As Boolean
Private F1DownHandled As Boolean
Private F2Down As Boolean
Private F2DownHandled As Boolean
Private XDown As Boolean
Private LeftArrowDown As Boolean
Private RightArrowDown As Boolean
Private SpaceDown As Boolean
```
- These variables track whether specific keys are currently pressed down. Each variable corresponds to a key that controls tank movement and actions.

### Timing Variables

```vb
Private TimeToNextRotation As TimeSpan = TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(1)
Private LastRotationTime As DateTime = Now
```
- **TimeToNextRotation**: This sets a minimal time interval for turret rotation.
- **LastRotationTime**: This records the last time the turret was rotated.

### Font and Text Variables

```vb
Private InstructionsFont As New Font("Segoe UI", 14)
Private InstructionsLocation As New Point(0, 0)
Private F1NoticeLocation As New PointF(0, 0)
```
- **InstructionsFont**: This defines the font used for displaying instructions.
- **InstructionsLocation**: This sets where the instruction text will appear on the screen.

### Hints and Instructions Text

```vb
Private HiddenHints As New String("Show / Hide Keyboard Hints > F1" & Environment.NewLine)
```
- **HiddenHints**: This string contains hints for keyboard controls.

```vb
Private KeyboardHintsText As New String("Show / Hide Keyboard Hints > F1" & Environment.NewLine & "Rotate Turret CounterClockwise > Left Arrow" & Environment.NewLine & "Rotate Turret Clockwise > Right Arrow" & Environment.NewLine & "Show / Hide Controller Hints > F2" & Environment.NewLine & "Rotate Hull Counterclockwise > A" & Environment.NewLine & "Rotate Hull Clockwise > D" & Environment.NewLine & "Forward > W" & Environment.NewLine & "Reverse > S" & Environment.NewLine & "Stop > E" & Environment.NewLine & "Fire > X" & Environment.NewLine)

```
- **ControllerHintsText**: Similar to the keyboard hints, this provides instructions for using a controller.
