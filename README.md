# Code Walkthrough

Welcome to the detailed code walkthrough for the **Tank** project! This guide will help you understand each line of the code, breaking down its functionality in a way that's beginner-friendly. Let's dive in!

## Class Definition

```vb
Public Class Form1
```
- **Public Class Form1**: This defines a new class named `Form1`, which represents the main window of our application. In Visual Basic, a class is a blueprint for creating objects, and here it will handle the game logic and user interface.

## Member Variables

```vb
Private DeltaTime As New DeltaTimeStructure(Now, Now, TimeSpan.Zero)
```
- **Private DeltaTime**: This variable holds an instance of `DeltaTimeStructure`, which is used to track the time elapsed between frames. It initializes with the current time (`Now`) and a zero time span.

```vb
Private OffScreen As New BufferManager(Me, BackColor)
```
- **Private OffScreen**: This creates a new `BufferManager` object, responsible for handling off-screen rendering to reduce flickering during drawing operations. It uses the form's background color.

```vb
Private Player As AudioPlayer
```
- **Private Player**: This declares a variable for managing audio playback in the game.

```vb
Private Turret As Turret
```
- **Private Turret**: This variable will hold an instance of the `Turret` class, which manages the tank's turret.
